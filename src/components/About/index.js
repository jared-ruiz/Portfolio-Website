                    <p>
                        Hey! Thank you for taking the time to check out my website! 
                    </p>
                    <p className='pt-4'>
                        I am a San Antonio based full stack web developer who recently made a huge career change from business marketing to tech! As soon as 2020 hit, 
                        a lot of lives around the world were forced to change and with that change, came a lot of opportunity to reevalute my current
                        interests and goals. I realized I wanted to jump into this industry as soon as possible and decided to enroll in a rigorous bootcamp hosted through UTSA. It was some of the
                        hardest work I have ever done in my life. I'm still surprised I made it through.
